This resource was based on [awesome-go's contributiion rules](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that we want to accept your contribution, but we have **some rules to keep the minimum quality** 
of the packages listed here. All reviews are **not personal feedback**, 
even if you are a _developer reviewing your contribution_. **Sorry if we can't meet your expectations, we do our best**.

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

This list is intended specifically for Solana mobile resources.  For a general list of Solana resources, check out [avareum's awesome-solana](https://github.com/avareum/awesome-solana).

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality standards

Standards will likely evolve with the ecosystem.  For now, here are a few basics:

- have an **open source license**, [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical);
- function as documented and expected;
- be either entirely limited to Solana mobile at the time, or a valuable resource for Solana mobile developers;
- be actively maintained with:
  - regular, recent commits;
  - or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to generally within 2 weeks;
- be stable or progressing toward stable;
- be thoroughly documented (README, etc.) in the english language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works.

## How to add an item to the list

Open a pull request against the README.md document that adds the repository to the list.

- The added item should be in alphabetical order within its category.
- The link should be the name of the package or project.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- Remember to put a period `.` at end of the project description.

If you are creating a new category, move the projects that apply to the new category, ensuring
that the resulting list has at least 3 projects in every category and that the categories are alphabetized.

Fill out the template in your PR with the links asked for. If you accidentally remove the PR template from the submission, you can find it [here](https://github.com/unofficial-saga-devs/awesome-solana-mobile/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Maintenance expectations for projects listed here

For now, there are no maintenance expectations, but this is likely to change in the future.

As long as a project is either functional or under active development, we'll keep it listed.

## How to remove an item from the list

- Open a pull request that deletes the line of the project in question.
- Delete the submission template and substitute a description of which criteria the project is not meeting. It should be a combination of the following.
  - The project is no longer open-sourced.
  - The project is not compatible with, or specific to, Solana mobile development or applications.

If the project is hosted on Github, include a link to the project's submitter and/or author so
that they will be notified of the desire to remove the project and have an opportunity to respond.
The link should be of the form @githubID.

If the project is not hosted on Github, open an issue at the project in question's repository linking to the PR 
and stating the following:

>This project is currently listed at awesome-solana-mobile at https://github.com/unofficial-saga-devs/awesome-solana-mobile. 
However, it appears that the project is not maintaining the quality standards required to continue to be listed at the awesome-solana-mobile project.
This project is scheduled to be removed within 2 weeks of this posting. To continue to be listed at awesome-solana-mobile, please respond at:
  -- link to above PR --
  
Then, comment on your PR at awesome-solana-mobile with a link to the removal issue at the project.

## Maintainers

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. They will wait 15 days for your interaction, after
that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
